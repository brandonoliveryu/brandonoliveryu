## Hi, I'm Brandon ðŸ‘‹

> I'm a Canadian based in the Bay Area, working on improving healthcare operating systems.

I was studying to become a clinician scientist at the University of Toronto after growing up with severe autoimmune diseases. I had the opportunity to work with various health systems on their technology, process, and policy - which has inspired me to focus on building products and systems that support our healthcare staff.

I've founded [Nucleate Dojo](https://nucleate.org/dojo/) and have been an early employee with several startups (backed by Y Combinator, Alt Capital, and more) in addition to adventures in consulting and venture capital.

Poker, basketball, and photography continue to be creative and competitive outlets for me. And now, code.
